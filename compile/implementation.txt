1.) Imma use a state machine or PDA to check between different states.
2.) Most productions will have a corresponding production* class in our code.
3.) The parser will obviously be done by ANTLR but the syntax correctness will be checked by us.
4.) Some production* classes can store data to the data store (like function declarations storing their information or variables).
5.) Terminal nodes such as parenthesis, keywords, identifiers, constants, etc. will be handled by productionTerminal class.
    a.) productionTerminal class will then convert the data into something our system can use and modify.
6.) Logical nodes will be handled by a productionLogicalExpression class
    a.) Any child nodes will not be processed by the mainParser. The productionLogicalExpression will be the one to process it (since this one is special along with arithmetic expressions).
7.) Arithmetic nodes will be handled by a productionArithmeticExpression class
